            <p>Alexander was born in Vancouver, BC, and has never settled residency elsewhere. He enjoys practicing martial arts,
                more specifically, kung fu. In addition to that, he loves tinkering with computers. This is why he decided to enrol
                in the CST program at BCIT, hoping to achieve greater knowledge. The area in Computing that Alex is  
                most passionate about is programming and coding in general. Needless to say, he really enjoys learning in COMP1510.</p>
