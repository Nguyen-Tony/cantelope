            <p>Emma has lived in Vancouver, BC about 95% of her life. Starting in North Vancouver, then moving into Downtown, and finally to the Kistilano area, she's been to quite a few schools.</p>
            <p>Although has been doing less of it since the CST program started, Emma enjoys drawing, reading, and playing games. Her favourite game is currently FFXIV, where she tries to keep her online friends alive as they run head-first into dungeons without protect spells. Most of the time she just sits and sips her tea, waiting for them to run back. </p>
