		Hi everyone!

		My name is Beny.

		I was born in Punjab (India), and was 8 years old when I moved to Canada.

		I love fitness, sports, and socializing with others. I have also done kickboxing, and boxing.

		I was wanting to get into CST, and had applied once for the January 2017 intake, but had been placed on the waiting list. I then upgraded my English marks and got into the September 2017 intake. I am very happy to be in CST program.

		I have some experience programming in Java, and have done some front-end, and back-end work using HTML, CSS, PHP, and have used mySQL.
