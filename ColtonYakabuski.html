            <p>Colton Yakabuski is a critically aclaimed student 
			born in Langley, BC. His hobbies include being incredibly
			average at almost everything he does and collecting scented candles. His favourite part about going to BCIT is being uncomfortably close to random people on the bus and Skytrain.</p>
